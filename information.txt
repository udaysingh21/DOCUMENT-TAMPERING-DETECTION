PCA, or Principal Component Analysis, is a tool used to simplify and understand complex data. 
Imagine you have lots of variables describing something, like features of a photo. 
PCA helps find the most important aspects (principal components) that capture the most variation in the data. 
It then allows you to visualize and analyze the data with fewer dimensions, making patterns and differences easier to see. 
It's like summarizing a big story with key points, making it simpler to grasp.


"Fewer dimensions" refers to reducing the number of variables or features used to describe data. 
In a dataset, each variable represents a dimension. 
For example, if you have data with height, weight, and age, you're working in three dimensions. 
PCA helps you identify the most relevant dimensions, called principal components, and discards less important ones. 
This reduction simplifies the data while retaining most of the important information. 
So, "fewer dimensions" means working with a smaller set of variables that still capture the main patterns and trends in the data.


Columns removed/adjusted before applying PCA are as follows:
    1. orig -> file path - non-numerical
    2. mse_lab -> negative values (PCA works only one non-negative values)
    3. img_f -> tuple 


Variance signifies the spread or variability of data points around the mean or center. 
In the context of PCA and dimensionality reduction, the explained variance ratio for each principal component indicates how much of the 
original data's variability is retained by that specific component
